<h2>Hi there, I'm Cami! <img align="center" src="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/thumbnails/045/385/633/small/cartoon-happy-cat-wearing-space-suit-free-png.png" width="40px"></h2>
I'm a Systems Analysis and Development student and a Full-Stack Developer.<br>
My coding journey began before I even knew what HTML and CSS were â€” I was fifteen when I started customizing Tumblr themes, and thatâ€™s how I fell in love with programming.
<br>
<br>
ðŸ’¡ I have experience with:
<ul>
  <li>Back-End Development using Java and Spring Boot</li>
  <li>Building RESTful APIs</li>
  <li>Front-End Development with React, HTML and CSS</li>
  <li>Working with SQL and NoSQL databases</li>
</ul>
<br> ðŸŽ“ I also hold certifications in Artificial Intelligence, including:
<ul>
  <li>AI-Assisted Certified Professional</li>
  <li>GenAI Technical Certification</li>
</ul>
<br>
ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm revisiting Front-End fundamentals and learning TypeScript and Node.js to expand my Full-Stack development skills.
